Being aware of this can ease your worries.\nIf swelling and redness occur at the injection site, applying a clean, cold, moist cloth can help reduce pain.\nPain, fever, and local reactions after vaccination: it is recommended to use antipyretic and pain-relieving medication but **not before vaccination** as it is ineffective and may reduce vaccine efficacy. After vaccination, if fever, pain, and restlessness occur, use paracetamol or ibuprofen in the appropriate dose for the child\'s weight and age, as advised by a pharmacist or doctor.\nAvoid tight clothing that puts pressure on the injection site.\nWashing the injection site and bathing the child after vaccination has no benefit.</string>
