# ðŸ‘¶ Koodoc: Your Child's Health Companion

Koodoc is an Android application designed to empower parents with essential tools and information to monitor and care for their childrenâ€™s health. Bridging the gap between professional medical care and day-to-day parental health management, Koodoc (derived from "Doctor" and "Koodak" - Persian for kid) is especially vital in regions with limited medical infrastructure.

## Why Koodoc?

- **Prevents Medication Errors**: Calculates accurate dosages based on child's weight and age, significantly reducing risks of underdosing or overdosing.
- **Early Growth Detection**: Tracks growth against standardized percentile curves, enabling early identification of developmental irregularities.
- **Empowers Parents**: Provides reliable, evidence-based health information, fostering confident parenting and better health outcomes.

## Key Features

Koodoc offers a comprehensive suite of tools, all within a bilingual (Farsi/English) and RTL/LTR UI supported environment:

- **Growth Chart**: Visualize your child's physical development over time with interactive charts for weight, height, and head circumference.
- **Dosage Calculator**: Precisely determine medication dosages based on individual child metrics.
- **Milk Formula Recommendations**: Get personalized milk formula suggestions considering age, allergies, and dietary needs.
- **Health Information Hub**: Access vital information on symptoms, poisoning, and vaccination schedules, including addressing common misconceptions.
- **Multi-language Support**: Seamlessly switch between Farsi and English with full UI adaptation.

## Technical Highlights

Built with modern Android technologies, Koodoc leverages:

- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language.
- **Android Jetpack**: Including Navigation Component, Room Persistence Library (for offline data), LiveData & ViewModel.
- **Dagger Hilt**: For robust dependency injection.
- **MPAndroidChart**: For dynamic and interactive growth chart visualizations.
- **Advanced Localization**: Custom `BaseActivity` and `MyLanguageManager` ensure comprehensive RTL/LTR support and dynamic language switching.

## Getting Started

Just run the project with a simulator or get the APK build using Android Studio.

## Future Enhancements

We are continuously working to improve Koodoc, with planned features including:

- **Vaccination Scheduler & Notifications**: Timely reminders for upcoming vaccinations.
- **Enhanced Growth Chart Visualization**: Displaying all three metrics (weight, height, head circumference) interactively.
- **Account Syncing Across Devices**: Securely sync child data across multiple parent devices.
- **Improved Accessibility**: Dark mode, larger text options, and screen reader support.
