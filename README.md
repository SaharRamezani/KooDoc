# 👶 Koodoc: Your Child's Health Companion

Koodoc is an Android application designed to empower parents with essential tools and information to monitor and care for their children’s health. Bridging the gap between professional medical care and day-to-day parental health management, Koodoc (derived from "Doctor" and "Koodak" - Persian for kid) is especially vital in regions with limited medical infrastructure.
